In winter, when the plants are dormant, winter pruning needs to be done (mainly on fruit trees, herbaceous perennials, ...)
During the rest of the year, some weeding also needs to be done.
These activities generate a lot of "waste biomass" (dried-out stalks and grasses, branches, pulled weeds, ...) so 
what options are there to  get rid of this and recirculate the nutrients of this waste matter back into your garden ?

The easiest way to get rid of dried-out stalks and grasses is to just burn them.
However, this poses a fire risk and generates a lot of smoke, both of which can cause problems ("environmental" laws, annoyed neighbours, ...)
