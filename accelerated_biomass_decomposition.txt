In winter, when the plants are dormant, winter pruning needs to be done (mainly on fruit trees, herbaceous perennials, ...)
During the rest of the year, some weeding also needs to be done.
These activities generate a lot of "waste biomass" (dried-out stalks and grasses, branches, pulled weeds, ...) so 
what options are there to  get rid of this and recirculate the nutrients of this waste matter back into your garden ?

The easiest way to get rid of dried-out stalks and grasses is to just burn them.
However, this poses a fire risk and generates a lot of smoke, both of which can cause problems (environmental laws, 
annoyed neighbours, ...) Relatively speaking, it does not harm the environment at all (because wildfires are also natural, and 
there are no CO2 emissions -because the CO2 it releases was first absorbed from the environment in the first place-, but it indeed 
does cause some air pollution which is probably the reason why the burning of plant matter is no longer allowed in some 
countries/regions.

Looking at the weed problem, the easiest way is to recycle the nutrients of this and get rid of it is to put it into a compost 
pile. However, for small gardens this too may not be an option since it does create smell, takes up a lot of space, and does not 
always look appealing (that last one is particularly a problem in small gardens as you can't really hide it well).

So looking on, what other options are there ?
