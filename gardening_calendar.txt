A gardening calendar allows you to schedule your gardening activities. It is especially useful to remind yourself when to sow and
harvest each crop, harvest seeds, prune trees, trim hedges, ...

To make it:
- Attain a blank calendar for next year (i.e. from http://calendar-12.com/printable_calendar/ )
- Next, get the moon phase data for next year (i.e. from https://www.calendar-12.com/moon_phases/ ) and indicate the new and full
moons on your calendar. Color the days between the new and full moons green (this indicates when you best sow leaf crops; waxing
moon) and color the days between the full and new moons yellow (this indicates when you best sow root crops; waning moon)
- Indicate on a blank space on each month of your calendar what crops you need to sow and what you need to harvest
- Indicate all other gardening jobs (pruning, trimming jobs, ... ) on the blank space of each month too
- Then, get the solstitiums data (summer & winter solstitiums) for next year and indicate these on your calendar. You can get the
data from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice .The summer solstitium marks the day with the most sunlight and thus the beginning
of summer. The winter solstitium marks the day with the least sunlight and thus the beginning of winter. Note that the wikipedia
data is for the northern hemisphere; in the southern hemisphere the date given for the summer solstitium is actually the winter
solstitium and vice versa. You may also want to mark the vernal and autumnal equinox data (get these from 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox ). These are halfway the 2 solstitiums and mark the begiining of spring and autumn (in
temperate climate zones).
